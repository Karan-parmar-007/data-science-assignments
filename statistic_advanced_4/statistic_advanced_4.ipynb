    "#### t-Test\n",
    "A t-test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It is particularly useful when dealing with small sample sizes (typically n < 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown. The t-test uses the t-distribution, which is wider and has heavier tails compared to the normal distribution, allowing for more variability when sample sizes are small.\n",

    "#### z-Test\n",
    "A z-test, on the other hand, is used when the sample size is large (typically n ≥ 30) and the population standard deviation is known. The z-test uses the z-distribution (standard normal distribution), which assumes the sample means are normally distributed due to the Central Limit Theorem.\n",

The sample sizes for each class are small (e.g., 15 students in each class), and the population standard deviations are unknown. In this case, a t-test would be appropriate to compare the means of the two classes.\n",

    "#### Scenario for a z-Test\n",
    "Consider a manufacturing company that produces light bulbs and claims that the average lifespan of their light bulbs is 1000 hours with a known standard deviation of 100 hours. A consumer group takes a random sample of 50 light bulbs and wants to test if the average lifespan of the sampled light bulbs is significantly different from the claimed 1000 hours.\n",

    "This demonstrates that increasing the sample size from 30 to 300 results in a smaller margin of error. The confidence interval for the average height estimate becomes narrower and more precise as the sample size increases. This precision is crucial in many practical scenarios, such as quality control in manufacturing, where knowing the exact specifications with high confidence is important.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The margin of error quantifies the uncertainty in an estimate of a population parameter.\n",
    "- Increasing the sample size decreases the margin of error, leading to more precise estimates.\n",
    "- In practice, larger sample sizes are often desired to obtain more reliable and accurate estimates, especially in fields like medicine, marketing, and social sciences.\n"
