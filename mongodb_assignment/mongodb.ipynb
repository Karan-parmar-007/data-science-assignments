    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that uses a document-oriented data model. Instead of storing data in tables as in a relational database, MongoDB stores structured data as JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making it flexible and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases (NoSQL) are databases that do not rely on the traditional table-based relational database model. They offer more flexibility in data storage and retrieval and are often used for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases come in different types, including document-based, key-value stores, wide-column stores, and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "1. Scalability: MongoDB's architecture allows for horizontal scalability, making it suitable for handling large-scale distributed data across multiple servers. It can easily scale out to accommodate growing data volumes and user loads.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Schema flexibility: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for dynamic changes in data structure without requiring a predefined schema. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data structure is not fixed or varies widely across different documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling unstructured data: MongoDB is well-suited for storing and retrieving unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON documents, binary data, or nested arrays, which may not fit well into the tabular structure of SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Agile development: MongoDB's schema-less design and flexible data model make it ideal for agile development environments where requirements may change frequently, allowing developers to quickly iterate and adapt to evolving data needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Real-time analytics: MongoDB's support for high-speed data ingestion and real-time analytics makes it suitable for applications requiring fast data processing and analysis, such as IoT (Internet of Things) applications, social media platforms, and real-time analytics systems.\n",

    "MongoDB is a widely used NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON), allowing for easy mapping to objects in application code. Each document can have its own unique structure, and related data can be nested within a single document or across multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Schema: MongoDB has a dynamic schema, meaning that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same schema or fields. This flexibility allows for easy modification of data structure without requiring a predefined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing it to handle large volumes of data and high-traffic applications by distributing data across multiple servers. It supports sharding, which partitions data across multiple servers to distribute workload and improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. High Performance: MongoDB's architecture is optimized for high performance and low latency. It uses memory-mapped files for storage and provides features like indexing, query optimization, and aggregation pipelines to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Security: MongoDB provides robust security features, including authentication, authorization, encryption, and auditing, to protect data from unauthorized access, ensure data privacy, and comply with regulatory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Flexibility: MongoDB can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments, providing flexibility and choice for deployment options. It also integrates with various tools and frameworks, making it easy to use with popular programming languages and development platforms.\n",

    "1. `delete_one()` Method:\n",
    "   - `delete_one()` is used to delete a single document that matches the specified filter criteria.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `collection.delete_one(filter)`\n",
    "   - Example: Deleting a single document with a specific `_id`:\n",

    "   - This method deletes only the first document that matches the filter criteria. If multiple documents match the filter, only one will be deleted.\n",

    "2. `delete_many()` Method:\n",
    "   - `delete_many()` is used to delete multiple documents that match the specified filter criteria.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `collection.delete_many(filter)`\n",
    "   - Example: Deleting all documents with the field \"status\" set to \"inactive\":\n",

    "\n",
    "   - This method deletes all documents that match the filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `drop()` Method:\n",
    "   - `drop()` is used to drop (delete) an entire collection from the database.\n",
