    "### Q1. Difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal Encoding**:\n",
    "- Ordinal encoding is used for categorical features where there is a meaningful order or ranking between the categories. For instance, \"Size\" might have categories \"Small\", \"Medium\", and \"Large\". In ordinal encoding, these categories could be encoded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "- **Example**: A feature \"Educational Level\" with categories [\"High School\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Master's\", \"PhD\"]. Here, \"High School\" < \"Bachelor's\" < \"Master's\" < \"PhD\". Therefore, ordinal encoding is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Encoding**:\n",
    "- Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category of a categorical feature without any consideration of the order or ranking between the categories. This method is generally used for categorical features where no ordinal relationship exists.\n",
    "- **Example**: A feature \"Color\" with categories [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"]. Since there is no intrinsic ordering, label encoding can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to choose one over the other**:\n",
    "- Use **ordinal encoding** when the categorical feature has an inherent order.\n",
    "- Use **label encoding** when the categorical feature has no intrinsic order.\n"

    "### Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**:\n",
    "- This method involves encoding the categorical variables based on the relationship between the categories and the target variable.\n",
    "- Categories are sorted by the mean (or median) of the target variable, and then an ordinal value is assigned to each category based on this ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Suppose you have a dataset with a categorical variable \"Neighborhood\" and a target variable \"House Price\". \n",
    "- Calculate the mean house price for each neighborhood.\n",
    "- Sort neighborhoods by mean house price.\n",
    "- Assign ordinal values based on this sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use**:\n",
    "- Use target guided ordinal encoding when the categorical variable has no natural order but you believe that the categories have different levels of impact on the target variable. For instance, in predicting house prices, neighborhoods might not have a natural order, but some neighborhoods might consistently have higher prices than others."

    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "- Covariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables. Positive covariance indicates that the variables increase together, while negative covariance indicates that one variable increases as the other decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance**:\n",
    "- Covariance is important in statistical analysis as it helps in understanding the relationship between variables, which is crucial for predictive modeling, portfolio theory in finance, and in multivariate statistics.\n"
