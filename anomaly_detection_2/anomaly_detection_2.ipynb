    "\n",
    "**DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**:\n",
    "- **Working**:\n",
    "  1. **Density Reachability**: Clusters are formed based on the density of points.\n",

    "  - Start with an arbitrary point.\n",
    "  - Retrieve all points within `epsilon` distance.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Effect of Epsilon**:\n",
    "- **Small Epsilon**: \n",
    "  - Results in many small clusters and many points labeled as noise (potential anomalies).\n",
    "  - May miss clusters that should be grouped together.\n",
    "- **Large Epsilon**: \n",
    "  - Results in fewer, larger clusters and fewer noise points.\n",
    "  - May group together points that should be considered anomalies.\n",
    "- **Optimal Epsilon**: \n",
    "  - Depends on the dataset and the scale of clustering.\n",
    "  - Needs to be tuned for best performance in detecting anomalies.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Core Points**:\n",
    "- Points with at least `min_samples` within `epsilon`.\n",
    "- Form the dense regions of clusters.\n",

    "  1. Build an ensemble of isolation trees.\n",
    "  2. For each point, compute the average path length from the root to the leaf.\n",
