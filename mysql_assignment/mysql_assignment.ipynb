    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed in a way that facilitates easy access, retrieval, and manipulation of data. Databases are used in various applications and industries to store and manage information efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a differentiation between SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "   - Structure: SQL databases are relational databases, which means they organize data into structured tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "   - Schema: They have a predefined schema, which defines the structure of the data, including data types and relationships between tables.\n",
    "   - ACID Properties: SQL databases typically adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NoSQL (Non-relational) Databases:\n",
    "   - Structure: NoSQL databases are non-relational, meaning they do not use a tabular structure like SQL databases. They are more flexible and can store unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "   - Schema: They are schema-less or have a dynamic schema, allowing for easy modification of data structure without downtime.\n",
    "   - Scalability: NoSQL databases are generally more scalable and can handle large volumes of data with ease, making them suitable for big data and real-time applications.\n",
    "   - Types: NoSQL databases are further categorized into different types such as document-based, key-value stores, wide-column stores, and graph databases.\n",
    "   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis, Amazon DynamoDB.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of commonly used DDL commands with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "   - Purpose: Used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or databases themselves.\n",
    "   - Example: Creating a new table named \"Employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and department:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "   - Purpose: Used to modify the structure of existing database objects, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns.\n",
    "   - Example: Adding a new column \"Salary\" to the \"Employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",

    "   ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "   ADD Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "   - Purpose: Used to remove all rows from a table while keeping the table structure intact.\n",
    "   - Example: Truncating the \"Employees\" table to delete all employee records:\n",
